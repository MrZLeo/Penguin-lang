# Draw-Lang
This is a compiler for a language that provide a python-like interface to draw figure.

- use `cargo run`to compile and use it.
- when program launch, you can see an interface like
```shell
>>> 
```

1. origin is (\<num)>, \<num>);
2. rot is \<num>;
3. scale is (\<num>, \<num>);
4. for x from \<num> to \<num> step \<num> draw(\<expr of x>, \<expr of x>)
5. exit

**project now is in the very beginning phrase of development, so all functions now will not run properly!**
